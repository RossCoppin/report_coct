abstract = {Since the publication of the paper of Dean (1974), loss on ignition (LOT) has been widely used as a method to estimate the amount of organic matter and carbonate mineral content (and indirectly of organic and inorganic carbon) in sediments. The relationships between LOI at 550 degreesC (LOI550) and organic carbon (OC) content and between LOI at 950 degreesC (LOI950) and inorganic carbon (IC) content are currently accepted as a standard. However, the comparison of 150 analyses of samples of diverse lithologies, collected from a single core, reveals that these relationships are affected by sediment composition (presence of clays, salts, and the variable content of organic carbon). This results in an incremental error on the estimation of carbon content from LOI values that invalidates the use of LOI values as a quantitative method for estimating carbon content. Conversely, the general trends of LOI550 and LOI950 show a good correlation with carbon content (both organic and inorganic) allowing use of LOI as a qualitative test for carbon content. Similarly, in our case, LOI at 105degreesC (LOI105) is a good qualitative proxy for the trends in gypsum content.},

abstract = {Beach-cast wrack is a prominent feature of beaches of south-western Australia. We examined the fauna of these beaches to explore the generalisation [Polis, G.A., Hurd, S.D., 1995. Extraordinarily high spider densities on islands: flow of energy from the marine to terrestrial food webs and the absence of predation. Ecology 92, 4382-4386] that beach-cast wrack from highly productive marine ecosystems subsidises low productivity of terrestrial ecosystems, to establish whether this generalisation is relevant to oligotrophic marine systems. We sampled three beaches with high and three beaches with low volumes of beach-cast wrack to determine if: (1) the presence of wrack influences the abundance of macroinvertebrates; (2) wrack acts as a food source for beach macroinvertebrates; and (3) the influence of wrack varies between zones above the high water mark. We measured wrack volume and composition, sediment characteristics, the abundance of different epibenthic and infaunal macroinvertebrates taxa, and $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates. The mean volume of wrack on high-wrack beaches was 0.27-1.07 m3wrack m-2compared to 0.00-0.09 m3wrack m-2on low-wrack beaches. There were no significant differences in sediment grain size, moisture content or loss on ignition between the two types of beaches or zones. Epibenthic fauna and infauna were consistently abundant on high-wrack beaches (20-291 and 0.5-3.5 individuals 0.64 m-2, respectively), but either absent or extremely rare in low-wrack beaches (0-3 and 0-0.1 individuals 0.64 m-2, respectively). Within high-wrack beaches, there were no significant differences in the abundance of epifauna or infauna among beaches or between zones. The $\delta$13C values of macroinvertebrates at all sites were most similar to red and brown algae, with the exception of beetles from two beaches, which were closest to seagrasses. Mixing model (Isosource) results for mesograzing amphipods and dipteran flies suggested carbon was assimilated mostly from the seagrass Posidonia spp., the dune grass Spinifex longifolia and red algae for amphipods and from brown algae, red algae and dune vegetation for dipteran flies. We conclude that the presence of marine-derived wrack plays a major role in subsidising production of macroinvertebrates on beaches of south-western Australia. We suggest that marine subsidies can play a role in supporting terrestrial production, even in oligotrophic marine environments. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Initial colonisation by cocci to lysis and release of cell contents. Lysed cells are then colonised by bacterial rods. High concentrations of leachates, reaching 5,640 mg carbon1 super(-1) subsequently appear beneath the decomposing kelp. Over 90{\%} of the carbon in these leachates is utilised by bacteria during drainage through a strip of sand 1 m long, 50 cm wide and 12 cm deep, although on an open beach other organisms, e. g. nematodes, may be capable of direct absorption of such organic matter. Calculation of carbon flow via grazing invertebrates and through bacteria shows that 23-27{\%} of the carbon in kelp is converted to bacterial carbon. Estimates of the bacterial carbon in equilibrium with the kelp cast up on the strandline suggest that 1648 g of kelp carbon is deposited per metre of strandline each 8 d.},
annote = {{\textgreater} This paper summarises the results of studies made on the realtive rate of utilisation of kelp by the dominant consumers and by microheterotrophic decomposer organisms. The results allowed us to make some quantitative estimates of the relative significance of consumer organisms and microheterotrophic pathways in the energetics of the sandy beach community. Stydy site was located at Kommetjie. Sampling included invertebrate consumer species, microbial communities and biochemical components.

{\textgreater} The results presented in this study suggest that bacteria are primarily responsible for the decomposistion and subsequent utilisation of kelp debris on the strandline, rather than fungi as generlly reported. Succession of microbial communities was also clear.

{\textgreater} Lysis of the cells, most likely through bacterial decomposition, results in the release of high concentrations of dissolved organic matter as leachates immediatey below decomposing kelp. Values as high as 5640 mg carbon l(-1) was recorded. The high concentrations of such compounds may result in the direct absorption by eiofauna which occurs under natural conditions in more mature sand columns on sandy open beaches.

{\textgreater} In the microcosom study, it was found that of 100 grams carbon in kelp 8.9{\%} was consumed by invertebrates.
{\textgreater}Grazers consumed {\~{}}6.9{\%} of orginal kelp carbon
{\textgreater} Broader study showed that 74{\%} of bech-cast kelp is consumed by the amphipod Talorchestia capensis and the diperan larvae Fucellia capensis, and the dipteran larva of Fucellia capensis.

{\textgreater} Carbon flow analyses of both decomposer and consumer dominated systems suggest that some 23 -27{\%} of the carbon from kelp is assimilated into large standing stock of bacterial carbon in the intertidal zone whilst the residual 73 to 77{\%} of the carbon from kelp is rapidly mineralised by the sand beach bacteria within {\~{}}8 days. This microbrial action is similar to what has been reported for water comlumns and therefore microbial communities play a central role in the rapid regeneration of inorganic materials needed to support the high primary production of a kelp bed.

abstract = {Kelp beds are thought to provide a refuge for a variety of marine organisms by damping waves, changing hydrodynamic flow, offering substrata for epiphytic species, and altering the abundances of predators and prey. At the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands, a typical flow-through system, kelp beds have the potential of acting as a prime habitat for a variety of pelagic species that would otherwise be swept away and lost from the island ecosystem. The current study investigates the effects of kelp beds on the abundance and composition of zooplankton and microphytoplankton, with the main aim of determining whether kelp beds act as a repository for larval stages in general, and for the swimming prawn, Nauticaris marionis, in particular. Salinity gradients created by freshwater run-off indicated that kelp beds at Marion Island retain surface water and restrict water exchange with the open ocean. Both the abundance and diversity of zooplankton were greatest within the kelp beds. This was partially due to the high abundance of kelp-associated species, but also to the apparent retention of naupliar larvae within the kelp canopy. Unlike the larvae of ostracods and copepods, caridean zoeae were rare, indicating that kelp beds are not a prime habitat for larvae of N. marionis. The larval retention mechanism for this species, therefore, remains unknown. Apart from retaining water and certain species of zooplankton, chlorophyll a/phaeopigment ratios confirmed the existence of a substantial detrital pool within the kelp beds. This retention of detritus may explain the observed importance of kelp-derived matter in the diet of many nearshore animals. In contrast to the zooplankton, kelp beds seemed to have little effect on the abundance and composition of microphytoplankton, and chlorophyll a values were low at all stations.},

As a case study of kelp detritus management, an observational study assessing the impacts of the practice of kelp burial at Clifton's 4th beach was conducted. Presented here is a review of the role kelp wrack plays in sandy shore ecosystems, descriptions of conflicts between and rationales of both DAFF and the Municipality, observations about beach sediment layers in areas of kelp burial on Clifton's 4th, and suggestions for management improvement for both specifically Clifton's 4th and the Cape Peninsula in general. Regulation by the Municipality was found to revolve around solely beach aesthetics, while management through DAFF deals with the collection of kelp for only commercial purposes. Though no patterns indicating the biological effects of kelp burial at Clifton's 4th beach were found, management suggestions for this beach include 1) the development of a map detailing location and date of kelp burial, and 2) investigation into the burial of beach-cast trash. Suggestions for management along the Cape Peninsula in general include 1) regular and improved communication between DAFF, the Municipality, and DAFF rights holders, 2) established protocols for dealing with conflict, 3) investigation into alternative use of kelp by the Municipality, and 4) records of quantities of kelp removed from beaches on the Cape Peninsula.},

abstract = {Vegetated coastal habitats have been identified as important carbon sinks. In contrast to angiosperm-based habitats such as seagrass meadows, salt marshes and mangroves, marine macroalgae have largely been excluded from discussions of marine carbon sinks. Macroalgae are the dominant primary producers in the coastal zone, but they typically do not grow in habitats that are considered to accumulate large stocks of organic carbon. However, the presence of macroalgal carbon in the deep sea and sediments, where it is effectively sequestered from the atmosphere, has been reported. A synthesis of these data suggests that macroalgae could represent an important source of the carbon sequestered in marine sediments and the deep ocean. We pro- pose two main modes for the transport of macroalgae to the deep ocean and sediments: macroalgal material drifting through submarine canyons, and the sinking of negatively buoyant macroalgal detritus. A rough estimate suggests that macroalgae could sequester about 173 TgC yr–1 (with a range of 61–268 TgC yr–1 ) globally. About 90{\%} of this sequestration occurs through export to the deep sea, and the rest through burial in coastal sediments. This estimate exceeds that for carbon sequestered in angiosperm-based coastal habitats.},

abstract = {We investigated the role of sandy beaches in nearshore nutrient cycling by quantifying macrophyte wrack inputs and examining relationships between wrack accumulation and pore water nutrients during the summer dry season. Macrophyte inputs, primarily giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, exceeded 2.3 kg m−1 day−1. Mean wrack biomass varied 100-fold among beaches (range=0.41 to 46.43 kg m−1). Mean concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), primarily NOx −-N, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in intertidal pore water varied significantly among beaches (ranges=1 to 6,553 $\mu$M and 7 to 2,006 $\mu$M, respectively). Intertidal DIN and DON concentrations were significantly correlated with wrack biomass. Surf zone concentrations of DIN were also strongly correlated with wrack biomass and with intertidal DIN, suggesting export of nutrients from re-mineralized wrack. Our results suggest beach ecosystems can process and re-mineralize substantial organic inputs and accumulate dissolved nutrients, which are subsequently available to nearshore waters and primary producers.},

abstract = {This review provides an overview of aspects of the ecology of drifting and beach-cast macroalgae and marine angiosperms in respect to present and potential commercial use of that resource in Australia. It sets the scene with sections on industries that utilise macro-algae and seagrasses, the ecology of littoral and nearshore sublittoral ecosystems and the processes of deposition of beach-cast macro-algae and seagrasses on beaches. It then describes the major economic macro-algae and seagrasses that occur as beach-cast wrack, with an emphasis on known information on habitat distribution, geographical range, and harvesting issues. Gaps in scientific knowledge are pointed out. The priority areas of future research were found to be: The importance of beach accumulations of macro-algae and seagrasses on feeding and nesting shorebirds; Whether available resource allows for ecologically and economically sustainable harvesting; A survey of present and potential commercial macro-algae and seagrasses: studying biomass, density and annual production rates, interannual variability of recruitment into living stands, the effect of harvesting on trophodynamics and community structure and the stability of the resource base for economically sustainable harvesting; An assessment of the importance of wrack in recycling nutrients and detritus to nearshore coastal ecosystems at wider geographical scales than previous work. This research should assess the dependence of offshore production on nutrients and detritus that are broken down in beachwracks.},

@article{Steneck2002,
abstract = {Kelp forests are phyletically diverse, structurally complex and highly productive components of cold- water rocky marine coastlines. This paper reviews the conditions in which kelp forests develop globally and where, why and at what rate they become deforested. The ecology and long archaeological history of kelp forests are examined through case studies from southern California, the Aleutian Islands and the western North Atlantic, well-studied locations that represent the widest possible range in kelp forest biodi- versity. Global distribution of kelp forests is physiologically constrained by light at high latitudes and by nutrients, warm temperatures and other macrophytes at low latitudes. Within mid-latitude belts (roughly 40–60° latitude in both hemispheres) well-developed kelp forests are most threatened by herbivory, usually from sea urchins. Overfishing and extirpation of highly valued vertebrate apex predators often triggered herbivore population increases, leading to widespread kelp deforestation. Such deforestations have the most profound and lasting impacts on species-depauperate systems, such as those in Alaska and the western North Atlantic. Globally urchin-induced deforestation has been increasing over the past 2–3 decades. Continued fishing down of coastal food webs has resulted in shifting harvesting targets from apex predators to their invertebrate prey, including kelp-grazing herbivores. The recent global expansion of sea urchin harvesting has led to the wide- spread extirpation of this herbivore, and kelp forests have returned in some locations but, for the first time, these forests are devoid of vertebrate apex predators. In the western North Atlantic, large predatory crabs have recently filled this void and they have become the new apex predator in this system. Similar shifts from fish-to crab-dominance may have occurred in coastal zones of the United Kingdom and Japan, where large predatory finfish were extirpated long ago. Three North American case studies of kelp forests were examined to determine their long history with humans and project the status of future kelp forests to the year 2025. Fishing impacts on kelp forest systems have been both profound and much longer in duration than previously thought. Archaeological data suggest that coastal peoples exploited kelp forest organisms for thousands of years, occasionally resulting in localized losses of apex predators, outbreaks of sea urchin popu- lations and probably small-scale deforestation. Over the past two centuries, commercial exploitation for export led to the extirpation of sea urchin predators, such as the sea otter in the North Pacific and predatory fishes like the cod in the North Atlantic. The large- scale removal of predators for export markets increased sea urchin abundances and promoted the decline of kelp forests over vast areas. Despite southern California having one of the longest known associations with coastal kelp forests, widespread deforestation is rare. It is possible that functional redundancies among predators and herbivores make this most diverse system most stable. Such biodiverse kelp forests may also resist invasion from non-native species. In the species-depauperate western North Atlantic, introduced algal competitors carpet the benthos and threaten future kelp dominance. There, other non-native herbivores and predators have become established and dominant components of this system. Climate changes have had measurable impacts on kelp forest ecosystems and efforts to control the emission of greenhouse gasses should be a global priority. However, overfishing appears to be the greatest manageable threat to kelp forest ecosystems over the 2025 time horizon. Management should focus on minimizing fishing impacts and restoring populations of functionally important species in these systems.},

@article{Dayton1985,
abstract = {The shallow subtidal rocky habitats in most temperate coastal areas are con- spicuously dominated by large brown algae in the orders Laminariales and Fucales. These algae are commonly referred to as kelps, although the term technically refers to Laminariales only. Their high productivity and com- plicated biological structure make kelps especially important members of their communities. For this reason, these communities havc received a great deal of research, including one of the first scientific applications of diving (128). This review summarizes the status of research programs operating within very different scales and emphasizes the point that a real understanding of the processes under study must come from the proper perspective and integration of the other levels. A taxonomic account of the world's kelps is far too complex for the scope of this review, but Mann (146) has characterized the world's kelp forests by their dominant genera. Laminaria species are found in many parts of the world but dominate both sides of the Atlantic and the coasts of China and Japan. Ecklonia dominates some kelp forests in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and a few other southern hemisphere localities. The giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, forms dense tbrests in many parts of the world including areas of the northeast Pacific, the southern shores of South America, many Southern Ocean islands, and isolated areas of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Macrocystis pyriJora does not occur in the eastern Pacific area north of San Francisco, California; however, this northern region has the highest species diversity of kelps in the world (63), with Macrocystis integrifolia and Nereocystis, Alaria, Pterygophora, and Laminaria, among other conspicuous genera. *The US Government has the right to retain a nonexclusive, royalty-free license in and to any copyright covering this paper. 215 Annual Reviews www.annualreviews.org/aronline 216 DAYTON Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 1985.16:215-245. Downloaded from arjournals.annualreviews.org by University of California - Santa Cruz on 07/03/06. For personal use only. The life cycle of all kelps consists of an alternation of generations between microscopic haploid gametophytes and large diploid sporophytes which pro- dhce reproductive sori, often on specialized sporophylls. Reduction division occurs in the sporangium, producing microscopic zoospores which are released to settle on the bottom and develop into male and female gametophytes. Gametophytes produce antheridia and oogonia; fertilization results in zygote formation and the growth of sporophytes. Most ecological studies have focused on the large sporophyte stage; however, recent work emphasizes the different threshold factors important to the separate life-history stages, especially the gametophytes and juvenile stages (50, 205). This review is possible because the huge and often rather diffuse literature has received excellent reviews (21, 80, 119, 146, 158, 183, 205). ! will emphasize the kelp community models being developed in the northeastern Pacific because of my own familiarity with the system.

This eliminates the major uptake of 5 1 {\~{}} r which is transferred to the ctenidia and palps of the suspension-feeding mussel Aulacomya ater(Mo1ina) from detritus labelled with 51Cr. The results suggest that although bacterial cultures based on isolates of kelp bacteria can be absorbed with an efficiency of 67 to 70 {\%}, the debris itself is also absorbed with an efficiency of approximately 50 {\%}. The kelp debris, which forms an important component of the particulate matter potentially available for consumers, may thus represent an important source of carbon for the filter feeding community adjacent to kelp beds. In contrast to the results obtained in other studies with artificial food sources, the data for kelp debris suggest that A. ateris able to maintain a positive scope for growth at the concentrations of suspended organic matter which occur under natural conditions in the kelp bed environment.},

@article{Bustamante1995a,
abstract = {The structure of rocky intertidal communities may be influenced by large-scale patterns of productivi- ty. In this study we examine the in situ rates of pro- duction by intertidal epilithic microalgae (chlorophyll a production per unit area per month), intertidal nutrient concentrations (nitrates, nitrites, phosphates and sili- cates), and standing stocks of different functional-form groups of macroalgae around the South African coast, and their relationships to consumer biomass. Clear gradi- ents of in situ intertidal primary production and nutrient concentrations were recorded around the South African coast, values being highest on the west coast, intermedi- ate on the south and lowest on the east coast. Primary production by intertidal epilithic microalgae was corre- lated with nutrient availability and could also be related to nearshore phytoplankton production. The dominance patterns of different functional forms of macroalgae changed around the coast, with foliose algae prevalent on the west coast and coralline algae on the east coast. However, overall macroalgal standing stocks did not re- flect the productivity gradient, being equally high on the east and west coasts, and low in the south. Positive rela- tionships existed between the average biomass of inter- tidal invertebrate consumers (grazers and filter-feeders) and intertidal productivity, although only the grazers were directly "connected" to in situ production by epi- lithic intertidal microalgae. The maximum body size of a widely distributed limpet, Patella granularis, was also positively correlated with level of in situ primary pro- duction. The maximal values of biomass attained by intertidal filter-feeders were not related to intertidal pri- mary production, and were relatively constant around the coast. At a local scale, filter-feeder biomass is known to be strongly influenced by wave action. This implies that the local-scale water movements over-ride any effects that large-scale gradients of primary production may have on filter-feeders. The large-scale gradient in inter- tidal productivity around the coast is thus strongly linked with grazer biomass and individual body size, but any effect it has on filter-feeder biomass seems subsidiary to the local effects of wave action.},

Fresh particles from Laminaria groenlandica, aged particles from Agarum fimbriatum and Alaria marginata, and mixed phytoplankton promoted the highest growth rates in both consumers. Growth was inversely related to total polyphenolic concentration in the fresh kelp particles.
